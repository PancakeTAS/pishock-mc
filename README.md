# pishock-mc
Minecraft, but it's 100x times more realistic (more or less).

pishock-mc is a fabric mod that punishes the player for taking damage or dying by shocking them with a shock collar. The mod supports multiplayer and requires both the server and client to have the mod installed (although client is optional).

## How do I use it?
Grab you and your friends a [Shock collar](https://pishock.com/).
Now simply clone the repository and `gradle build` it, and move the mod from `build/libs` to your mods folder.
You're also going to need ModMenu and ClothConfig in order to actually change the settings.

Finally, launch the game and tweak the settings from the main menu.

## Is it tested?
There's an SMP planned... but it hasn't occured yet
